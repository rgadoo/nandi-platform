# Chat Components Documentation

## Overview
The Chat system is a core feature of the Nandi platform, providing users with personalized spiritual guidance through AI-powered chat personas. Each persona offers unique insights and perspectives aligned with different spiritual aspects.

## Theme Structure
Each chat persona has the following theme properties:

{
  id: 'karma',             // Unique identifier
  name: 'Lumina âš¡',        // Display name with emoji
  color: '#FF9800',        // Theme color
  position: 'bottom',      // Position on screen
  description: 'Wisdom & Life Choices',
  themeDescription: 'Guides decisions through clarity & insight',
  avatarImage: '/images/chat-avatars/karma-avatar.png'
}
```

## Persona-Specific Welcome Messages

Each chat persona has a unique welcome message that sets the tone for the conversation:

**Lumina âš¡ (Wisdom & Life Choices)**:
> "Life is full of choices. Some are small, some are big, but they all shape our path. What's on your mind today?"

**Nova ðŸ”® (Personal Growth & Purpose)**:
> "Every step forward starts with a question. Where are you headed? Let's figure it out together."

**Solis ðŸŒ¿ (Mindfulness & Inner Peace)**:
> "Take a breath. You don't have to have all the answers right now. Let's take a moment to slow down and see things clearly."

## Mobile Responsiveness
The chat system includes specific optimizations for mobile use:
